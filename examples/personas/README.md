# Personas Folder

This folder contains persona definition files for USD with sonic characters.

\n- `elias_driftborn.ai` is a specific hand-made musical persona.
- `playlists_human2.ai` or `poetic_emotions.ai` can be added in the same format.

- `persona-composer.prompt` defines a custom TV System Prompt that synthesizes a persona by interviewing the user.

\n## Using the Prompt

To generate a new persona file:
1. Load the `examples/personas/persona-composer.prompt` file into your favorite Custom GPT tool on ChatGPT.com
2. Respond to its questions as a character in musical, word-associative language.
3. At the end, it will generate a `{}.ai` file with key-pair properties.
4. Save this file in the `personas` folder or use it with a compose module.

\n## Example Starter
